      <h3>What is Mental Health?</h3>
      <p>
        Mental health refers to cognitive, behavioral, and emotional well-being. It‚Äôs how individuals handle stress, relate to others, and make choices. It doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre happy all the time ‚Äî it means you‚Äôre able to cope with the ups and downs of life.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you're mentally healthy, you enjoy your life, your environment, and the people in it. You can be creative, learn, try new things, and take risks. You can cope when times are tough in your personal or professional life.

      <h3>Why Mental Health Awareness Matters</h3>
      <p>When we talk about mental health openly, we make it easier for others to seek help. Awareness reduces stigma, encourages empathy, and creates a community where people feel seen and heard. It also increases funding, research, and resources for prevention and recovery programs.</p>
      <p>Schools, workplaces, and communities benefit when mental health is prioritized. It leads to better focus, creativity, productivity, and relationships.</p>

      <h3>Mental Health vs Mental Illness</h3>
      <p>Mental health refers to our overall emotional and psychological well-being. Mental illness, on the other hand, includes specific diagnosable conditions that affect how we think, feel, and behave. It‚Äôs possible to have good mental health while living with a mental illness, and it‚Äôs also possible to experience poor mental health without having a diagnosable condition.</p>
      <p>Understanding this difference is essential to reduce stigma. Mental illness is not a character flaw or weakness. It‚Äôs a medical condition‚Äîjust like asthma or diabetes‚Äîand it deserves support and treatment.</p>
