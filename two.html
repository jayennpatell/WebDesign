        <li><strong>Volunteer your time:</strong> Local support groups, school clubs, and awareness events always need help.</li>
        <li><strong>Create safe spaces:</strong> Let people know you're someone they can talk to without judgment.</li>
        <li><strong>Be an advocate:</strong> Write to local leaders or participate in mental health policy events.</li>

      <h3>Small Actions, Big Impact</h3>
      <p>
        You don’t have to do everything. Just do something.
        Even small acts — checking in on a friend, sharing a hotline, posting a mental health tip — can have a ripple effect. The more we normalize these conversations, the more lives we impact.
      </p>
      <p>
        Remember: change starts with awareness, and awareness starts with you.
